What My Bones Know: A Memoir of Healing from Complex Trauma by Stephanie Foo Book Review

Name: R. M. Whalen
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Amazing Book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2023
Review: This is an amazing and must-read book for anyone -- and especially for someone who deals with trauma or even complex PTSD. The author tells her story in an engaging way yet shares amazing tips we can apply to our own lives. I learned so much while reading this book, and am so inspired by Stephanie's story and resilience. I highly recommend reading her book.

I love switching between the audio version of a book and the Kindle version (that way I can listen to a book while driving or walking my dog and then pick up where I left off on my Kindle). Although I have the Kindle version, the Audible version was even better, and read by the author herself.

Title: I'm begging everyone to read this. ‚ù§‚ù§
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2023
Review: I initially listened to this on audio book. The author is the narrator and it was amazing.

This is a memoir about Stephanie's personal journey through trauma. It is mixed with a personal narrative and facts about CPTSD. It felt emotional, personal and I felt so well informed. I didn't understand too much what CPTSD was before this, but between being given the facts and the facts applies to Stephanie's life, I really grasped the reality of her truama. Her narrative helped me better understand my personal experiences.

This book was an incredible and eye opening journey that I feel I took with Stephanie that also helped me with my journey.

I will beg anyone who has had any kind of trauma to read this book. It is amazing and a top read for 2022.

Title: Brave & timely
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2023
Review: We‚Äôre in good hands. There is SO much trauma. C-PTSD is a relatively ‚Äúnew‚Äù diagnosis. I‚Äôve struggled with it my entire life. I wonder at where Foo will be, what wisdom she will be involved in regaling younger generations with, by the time she is my age. I‚Äôm very grateful for her journey, and the fact that she has shared it. It is SO important.

Title: Thought Provoking
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2023
Review: I read half of the book in one day and immediately messaged my therapist and told her I had a list of things I wanted to discuss. Right now I am battling my own fight healing from CPTSD as well as making my way through a masters program to become a counselor. This book challenged my thoughts on PTSD as well as better informed me about the impact of trauma and generational trauma on minority families. I highly recommend this book to literally anyone and everyone. So so grateful people are willing to share their experiences in this way.

Review: Wow. This book was phenomenal. I had to read it in phases bc it got really hard at times due to my own experiences. I feel like a better person for reading this. I found myself cheering out loud, crying uncontrollably and laughing at our similarities. Amazing.

Title: What everyone with C-PTSD and those who love them should read
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2022
Review: In this book, Stephanie Foo takes us through her entire journey as she seeks to understand her C-PTSD and heal. As someone who also has been diagnosed with C-PTSD myself, I found her authenticity, vulnerability, wit, and humor to be utterly relatable and filled with love, understanding, and compassion. This book is endearing, hopeful, and healing. If you have been diagnosed with C-PTSD or you love someone who has been diagnosed with it, I HIGHLY recommend you read this book. In sharing her own path to healing Stephanie shows us all that there is another side, that there is hope, and that healing is possible.

Title: inspirational
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2023
Review: Ms Foo is powerfully articulate as she describes the effect of C-PTSD on her personal development, her professional life and her relationships. Her persistence and commitment to healing even when feeling almost completely defeated is awe inspiring. As a therapist with over forty years experience, I am so gratified to have had the opportunity to read her story and would highly recommend it to other mental health professionals
